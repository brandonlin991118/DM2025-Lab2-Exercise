      "Data mining is the process of **discovering patterns, insights, and knowledge from large datasets**. It's essentially about **finding hidden gems of information** within vast amounts of data that aren't readily apparent through simple observation or traditional analytical methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The Data:** Imagine a massive library filled with countless books, articles, and documents. This is your raw data.\n",
      "*   **Traditional Analysis:** You might skim a few books or read a specific chapter to find information on a topic. This is like basic querying or simple reporting.\n",
      "*   **Data Mining:** Data mining is like having a super-powered, intelligent librarian who can read *all* the books simultaneously, identify recurring themes, predict future trends based on past content, and even suggest connections between seemingly unrelated subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key aspects of Data Mining:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining is typically applied to datasets that are too large and complex for manual analysis. This can include databases, logs, social media feeds, sensor data, and more.\n",
      "*   **Discovery-Oriented:** The goal isn't to answer a predefined question (though it can help with that too). It's about exploring the data to uncover unexpected relationships, trends, and anomalies.\n",
      "*   **Pattern Recognition:** Data mining algorithms are designed to identify various types of patterns, such as:\n",
      "    *   **Associations/Affinity:** \"Customers who buy product A also tend to buy product B.\" (e.g., market basket analysis)\n",
      "    *   **Sequences:** \"If a customer purchases a laptop, they are likely to purchase a printer within the next month.\"\n",
      "    *   **Classifications:** \"Categorizing emails as spam or not spam based on their content.\"\n",
      "    *   **Clustering:** \"Grouping customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.\"\n",
      "    *   **Outliers/Anomalies:** \"Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.\"\n",
      "    *   **Predictions/Forecasting:** \"Estimating future sales based on historical data.\"\n",
      "*   **Interdisciplinary:** Data mining draws upon techniques from various fields, including:\n",
      "    *   **Statistics:** For understanding data distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling.\n",
      "    *   **Machine Learning:** For developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or classifications.\n",
      "    *   **Database Systems:** For efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.\n",
      "    *   **Artificial Intelligence:** For creating intelligent systems that can process and interpret data.\n",
      "    *   **Information Visualization:** For presenting the discovered patterns in an understandable way.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Data Mining Process (often follows a CRISP-DM methodology):**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Business Understanding:** Define the problem and the goals of the data mining project.\n",
      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Explore and get familiar with the data, identify potential data quality issues.\n",
      "3.  **Data Preparation:** Clean, transform, and select the data needed for analysis. This is often the most time-consuming step.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Select and apply appropriate data mining algorithms to the prepared data.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models and ensure they meet the business objectives.\n",
      "6.  **Deployment:** Integrate the discovered knowledge into operational systems or decision-making processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is Data Mining Important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Data mining has become indispensable for businesses and organizations across various sectors due to its ability to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Improve Decision-Making:** Provide data-driven insights to make more informed and strategic choices.\n",
      "*   **Increase Efficiency:** Automate processes, optimize resource allocation, and identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "*   **Understand Customers:** Gain deeper insights into customer behavior, preferences, and needs for personalized marketing and product development.\n",

      "  Title: Machine Learning (ML)\n",
      "  Explanation: Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention. It involves algorithms that are trained on datasets to perform specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or recommendation systems, without being explicitly programmed for each outcome. \n",

      "  Explanation: Data Centers are dedicated physical facilities that house networked computer servers, storage systems, and associated infrastructure such as telecommunications and environmental controls (e.g., power, cooling, security systems). They are designed to process, store, and manage vast amounts of data, providing the foundational computing power and reliability required for modern digital services and applications. \n",

      "  Title: Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
      "  Explanation: Large Language Models are a class of artificial intelligence models, specifically deep learning models, that are trained on massive datasets of text and code. They leverage neural network architectures, particularly transformers, to understand, generate, and process human language. LLMs can perform a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. \n",
      "\n",
      "  Title: The Interrelation\n",
      "  Explanation: LLMs are a highly advanced application within the field of Machine Learning. Their development and operation are critically dependent on Data Centers. Training an LLM requires immense computational power and vast storage capacity to process terabytes of data and execute billions of parameters, tasks that can only be effectively managed by the specialized hardware (GPUs, CPUs) and infrastructure provided within Data Centers. Data Centers thus serve as the essential physical and computational backbone, providing the scalable, reliable, and secure environment where Machine Learning models, especially resource-intensive LLMs, are developed, trained, and deployed. In essence, Data Centers provide the 'engine room' for the 'intelligence' created by Machine Learning, with LLMs being one of the most prominent outcomes. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "The zero-shot model performs emotion classification with no examples provided, relying only on task instructions.\n",
    "It achieved the lowest overall accuracy (around 45–50%), showing that without contextual examples, the model\n",
    "often confuses similar emotions such as “fear” and “sadness”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding one example per emotion (1-shot) noticeably improved performance.\n",
    "The model achieved around 55% accuracy, indicating that even a single example\n",
    "helps the LLM understand tone and linguistic context. The confusion matrix shows\n",
    "fewer cross-category errors, particularly for “joy” and “sadness”, though “fear” remains\n",
    "a challenging class due to its subtle expression in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5-shot setting produced the most balanced and robust results.\n",
    "Accuracy further increased (typically 60–65%), and misclassifications between “anger”\n",
    "and “sadness” were reduced. The model benefits from richer contextual grounding across emotions.\n",
    "This demonstrates the expected few-shot learning behavior — performance improves as the model\n",
    "is given more exemplars, helping it align internal representations more closely with each emotion’s semantics.\n",

    "we can analyze three main behavioral patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cases Where Classification Improved with More Examples:**\n",
    "   Many ambiguous or mixed-sentiment posts (e.g., sarcasm, indirect anger)\n",
    "   that were misclassified in zero-shot became correct under 5-shot prompting.\n",
    "   Example: A tweet expressing frustration but with polite wording was initially labeled “sadness”\n",
    "   but correctly reclassified as “anger” once examples provided stronger emotional cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cases Where It Did Not Improve:**\n",
    "   Certain “fear” samples consistently remained misclassified, regardless of examples.\n",
    "   This suggests inherent ambiguity or lexical overlap (e.g., “I’m worried but hopeful”).\n",
    "   The model may still rely on general sentiment polarity rather than the subtle context of fear.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cases Where Performance Got Worse:**\n",
    "   A few short or sarcastic texts that were correct under 1-shot became incorrect in 5-shot.\n",

    "**Findings:**\n",
    "   - Few-shot prompting generally stabilizes predictions.\n",
    "   - Improvements are most pronounced for emotions with clearer lexical markers (“joy”, “anger”).\n",
    "   - “Fear” remains the hardest category due to nuanced expression and limited exemplars.\n",
    "   - Over-conditioning on examples (too many shots) can reduce flexibility in ambiguous cases.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
